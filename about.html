            <h2>Who are Vicious Cycles?</h2>
            <p>Vicious Cycles is a local store for bikers. These can be casual bikes, mountain bikes, high-performance tricked-out BMX bikes, etc. Alternately, these can be Harley Davidson, an American Eagle, mopeds, scooters, Kawasaki’s, or even concept vehicles. 
               The choice of item is up to you. What brands do you want to sell? Or be a dealer for? Vicious also sells accessories.

               <h2>Owner Bio</h2>
               <p>After spending my whole life on pedals, finishing my degree in mechanical engineering and working for two large companies making bikes I decided to change my priorities in life. 
                  I’ve never been good at sitting in an office waiting for Friday to come so, decided to start being self-employed. 
               </p>
               <p>While I started off with engineering projects for companies in the bike industry, I also began to make notes and write down ideas for the bike I would make myself. 
                  I soon felt that my excitement wasn’t going to get any less and decided to explore the road of what has now become Vicious!

               <h2>Our Philosophy</h2>
               <p>Our philosophy is that when you choose your bike, you should choose it based on the folks who will not only build your bicycle, but also those who will help you get comfortable on the bike, 
                  as well as provide service down the road as you need it.
               </p>
               <p>The best things in life are pretty simple. Riding bikes with friends, discovering new places and finding new trails are definitely included. Riding bikes helps us to disconnect from the hectic and noisy world and connect with friends, nature and ourselves. It might just be the best thing ever.</p>
